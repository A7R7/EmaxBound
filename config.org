* Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: f3aacf74-1f96-4b4f-932c-60805a632437
:END:

** How to deploy this config
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 5e6cc345-e6c5-4652-9041-7ba1d6eb58b8
:END:
This config file is still in its early stages of development, *Everything is unstable!*
To play around with my config files, clone this repo anywhere you like on your system.
#+begin_src bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/A7R7/EmaxBound.git
#+end_src

Then, simply execute these make rules inside the repo directory.
#+begin_src bash
make bootstrap-borg  # bootstrap borg itself
make bootstrap       # bootstrap collective or new drones
#+end_src

Last, run ~emacs --init-directory=<path-of-the-repo>~ (replace the path).

** How I built this config from the seed
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: f2cf02e1-4051-403d-8b43-9465c0ffc346
:END:

The whole config structure is built upon [[https://github.com/emacscollective/emacs.g][emacscollective/emacs.g]].
It is a starter-kit using borg as the package manager, which utilizes git submodules to maintain all its packages.
Check [[https://emacsmirror.net/manual/borg/Bootstrapping-using-a-seed.html][Bootstrapping-using-a-seed]] from Borg's manual to see how to build the config structure.

+ First, I generated the structure from the seed.
+ Then, I copied and pasted all the original code from init.el and early-init.el to this org file.
+ Last, most further config does not go beyond the following 3 steps:
  - Run [[elisp: borg-assimilate][M-x borg-assimilate]] and input the name of the package to install this package.
  - Write config codes into this org file, then run [[elisp:org-babel-tangle][M-x org-babel-tangle]] so that emacs writes the codes into the corresponding file. (the org-auto-tangle package that I installed enables auto tangling on saving org file)
  - For some packages, specify its load path or build method in ~.borgconfig~ for them to be load or built as expected. This is auto tangled as well.

** Why it's called EmaxBound
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 57396c12-74f2-41c4-9b65-2bc866a305d6
:END:

The name "EmaxBound" is inspired by "Starbound", a game I used to play and I love it.
Why it is "EmaxBound" but not "EmacsBound" ?
- "Emax" has the same number of characters of "Star"
- So that the logo I drawed (mimicing the style of starbound) looks balanced
- "Emaxbound" means "Explore the maxium bound of emacs"

** Why not other popular emacs distros
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: d4ab13f2-c03e-4da6-904c-26e9111e11a4
:END:

+ Doom emacs, spacemacs and other emacs "distros", are pretty good. They did a good job in "working out of the box". However, their complexities is blocking me from gaining a further understanding of emacs and elisp.
+ Meanwhile, it's much harder to do customizations on those complex systems, especially when you do not know what it already have. However, self-configured emacs does not have this problem.
+ Those distros get updates from time to time. What if one update breaks your workflow?

** Why a literate config
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 00a4f4b9-289a-4a01-b5f8-fffdefb5bebe
:END:

Using literate configuration in org-mode has many benefits.
- You know what you code does, because there're descriptions in various styles around the code. Code comments cannot achieve 100% of this.
- Easy jumping to the target code block among those foldable outlines.
- Hot reload code blocks: after editing a src block, ~C-c C-c~ to apply changes on the fly.
- The org file can be used as readme in github/gitlab, which shows all your codes. It can be published as blogs. For example, I use ox-hugo to generate markdown files, and later hugo renders it to html files. This is where this blog comes from.

*NOTE*: elisp codes under this headline are tangled to early-init.el.

Emacs load early-init.el before the initalization of GUI, which is before init.el.

Enable lexical-binding. Disable byte-compile for early-init.el.

According to the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html][emacs manual]], byte-compiling the init does not startup very much, and often leads to problems when you forget to recompile the file. Also, from my experience, it may lead to bugs that do not happen when not using byte-compile.

** Borg

:END:
[[https://github.com/emacscollective/borg][Borg]] is the package manager that I use for my configuration. It assimilate Emacs packages as git submodules, which are called "=drones=" in borg's specific.

Borg clones all drones into ~borg-drones-directory~ (by default ~user-emacs-directory/lib~).
The drones are not added to the load path until ~borg-initialize~ is called. In a nut shell ~borg-initialize~ is a loop of ~borg-activate~ on all assimilated (and not disabled) drones, which adds the drone to the load path and eval its autoloads.

Here we add ~lib/borg~ to the load-path before borg is loaded, and then call ~borg-initialize~ to add all packages to the load path and eval their autoloads.

And then we switch to the message buffer in an attempt to make the loading process not that boring.
#+begin_src elisp

We set the custom-file to custom.el and then load it.

It's not a good idea to put too many customizations in the custom file, especially for a =declarative configuration=. If one wants to make something permanent, he should write them down in the user configuration file (like here).

On the other hand, some unimportant customizations that change over time based on user's likes are better suited to be placed in the custom file, a good example is the =theme=.

We try to decide what emacs would look like beneath this outline.
However, many packages affect how emacs looks.
To make it simplier, we'll just define things that only changes how emacs looks, but do not provides extra functionalities or stuffs, meanning that deleting them will not affect how emacs works (hopefully).

** Fonts
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 94ead78c-1e1b-4f6f-b78f-5d805c08519b
:END:
Fonts in emacs is really a complex system. If you don't treat it with care, you'll definitedly encounter some bugs.

One essential thing about font is pitch. In general, pitch control's whether a font is fixed-widthed or non-fixed-widthed. Currently there're 2 helpful packages that controls font pitch: =mixed-pitch-mode= and =fixed-pitch-mode=.

I recommend stick to only one of these modes and does all the font settings based on the mode. For me I choses =fixed-pitch-mode=. This mode makes certain major mode have fixed-pitch fonts, and left all the other fonts to the default font (which can be set to some non-fixed-pitch fonts). It has a simplier implementation than mixed-pitch-mode.

What is a backlink? If there's a link at A pointing to B, and in the same time if there's also a link at B pointing to A, then the link at B can be called the backlink of the link at A.

I'm using two plugins that handles backlink. =Org-super-links= handles inserting backlinks in current buffer. =Org-roam= inserts links and backlinks between different org files.

Org super links handles backlink inside the current file. When inserting link to a target using ~org-super-links-link~, it automatically inserts a backlink at the target.

I think this is what makes Org's tree-style structure more complete. A tree style structure is efficient in dividing a big object into many smaller ones. But it's possible that two children share something in common, but do not belong to the same parent. In this case backlinks does the job.
